# Project Proposal: On Time
## Overview
Managing time and staying on top of deadlines can be challenging, especially with a busy schedule. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed and lose track of important tasks. That’s where our project, On Time, comes in.

On Time is a Task Management System designed to help you effortlessly track your tasks and set reminders. With our platform, you can organize your workload, prioritize effectively, and stay on top of your deadlines with ease.

## Functional Requirements
Add Task: Allows the user to add new tasks to their list.
Remove Task: Enables the user to delete tasks they no longer need.
Set Reminder: Lets the user set deadlines and reminders for specific tasks.
Check Task: Provides the ability to mark tasks as completed once they are done.
Add an Account: Allows users to create an account, ensuring their data is saved and accessible across sessions.
Login: Allows a user to access their account by verifying their credentials.
## Non-functional Requirements
Data Persistence: The system must handle persistent data storage to ensure that all critical information is retained between sessions. This will be managed through the account creation feature.
Scalability: The system should support at least 50 concurrent users without performance degradation.
Response Time: All transactions, such as adding or checking tasks, should complete within a 3-second response time.
User-Friendliness: The system should have an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, ensuring that users can perform tasks such as adding, removing, and searching for tasks with minimal effort and no prior training.
Security - Password Protection: The system must require users to create a secure password when creating an account. Passwords should be stored securely using encryption, and users must authenticate themselves with their password to access their accounts.
